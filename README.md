# vista-notes
Basic Example of writing notes to VistA.  In the index.js file I have included an example of how to write and sign an note.   This example is for a historical note and does not have an encounter.  I will add an example of that soon. 

1) create config.js and add the required information. 
2) node .

This was written against station 500 (dev) in OCTO.
