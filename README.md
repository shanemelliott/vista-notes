# vista-notes
Basic Example of writing notes to VistA.  In the index.js file I have included an example of how to write and sign an note.   This example is for a historical note and does not have an encounter.  I will add an example of that soon. 

1) create config.js and add the required information. 
2) node .

This was written against station 500 (dev) in OCTO. 


There is now a basic user interface to demonstrate using RPCs to write notes. 

you can access at: http://localhost:4567 after launcing the node app.
