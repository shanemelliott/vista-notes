# vista-notes
Basic Example of writing notes to VistA.  In the index.js file I have included an example of how to write and sign an note.   This example is for a historical note and does not have an encounter.  I will add an example of that soon. 

1) create config.js and add the required information. 
2) node .

This was written against station 500 (dev) in OCTO. 

There is another branch with a very simple web interface (Add-web-interface).  I did the RPC calls on the node side to make the implementation simpler and put auth / signature code in a config file, but you could do it all in the client.
